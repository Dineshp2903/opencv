### Erosion
## Erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object
##Used to diminish the features of an image.
img_erosion = cv2.erode(image,kernal,iterations=1)
cv2.imshow("Erosion",img_erosion)
### Uses
#It is useful for removing small white noises.
#Used to detach two connected objects etc.

### Dilation
#Increases the object area
#Used to accentuate features
dilation = cv2.dilate(image,kernal,iterations=1)
cv2.imshow("Dilation",dilation)
### Uses
##In cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. Because, erosion removes white noises, but it also shrinks our object. So we dilate it. Since noise is gone, they wonâ€™t come back, but our object area increases.
##It is also useful in joining broken parts of an object.
